    "1. Change the number of neurons in the hidden layer.\n",

The [Keras Layer documentation](https://keras.io/api/layers/) includes information about the layers supported. In particular, [`Conv2D`](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d) and [`MaxPooling2D`](https://keras.io/api/layers/pooling_layers/max_pooling2d) layers may be useful."
